// This file is auto-generated - contains serialized blog posts data for client components
// It will be populated at build time with blog posts from markdown files
// For now, this is a placeholder that will be used when we need client-side access

// This array will be populated during build by a script or at build time
export const blogPostsData: BlogPost[] = []

// Note: For production, you might want to generate this file during build
// or use Next.js API routes to fetch posts on the client side
